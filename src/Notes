1- About Classes:

* look for Names from the Problem descriptions
* think object rather methods or verbs
* think is it necessary? don't just do it for the sake of doing it or having many classes


2- Naming convention:
* use the things that were given in the problem description as far as possible.
*  say what it is or what it does not something else.
