1- About Classes:

* look for Names from the Problem descriptions
* think object rather methods or verbs
* think is it necessary? don't just do it for the sake of doing it or having many classes


2- Naming convention:
* use the things that were given in the problem description as far as possible.
*  say what it is or what it does not something else.


3- refactoring:
State your goal and idea first -- like from what you are right now to where you want to be after refactoring -- and work it out from there.
